# Pi Internet Radio Tuner
This net radio tuner project was developed on the Orangepi Zero 3.  
It should work with any board or other Linux system.  The objective 
was to implement an inexpensive network-controlled (via any browser) 
tuner that could allow playback of stations saved in a simple preset 
system.  A simple CSV file is used to store presets, and recall for 
easy playback in the webUI.  The intended use case is to connect the
system to the network by wire or wifi, then connect a USB sound output.
Playback and management is all done via the webUI from any browser.

I welcome any improvements and contributions via a pull request and I 
hope you enjoy the project as much as I do!
